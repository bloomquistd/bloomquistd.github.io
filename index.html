            <p><strong>The Trump Administration's Impact on Immigration</strong></p>
            <p>
                The Trump Administration's first term was wrought with controversial immigration policies. His hallmark campaign promise of <br>
                a border wall was meant to secure the country from illegal immigration from Mexico. This was coupled with a harsh deportation<br>
                enforcement that resulted in separating families, housing them in facilities Former First Lady Laura Bush compared to the<br>
                internment camps used for Japanese-Americans during WW2. The administration attempted to enact a ban on immigration from <br>
                13 Muslim-majority countries. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the first year of his second term, Trump has resumed his aggressive tactics with regards to immigration. ICE has begun<br>
                an aggressive deportation campaign, and the "Big Beautiful Bill" expands funding for ICE and border security to $170 billion.<br>
                The Trump administration's tariff policy has also impacted tourism, seeing a 22%, 17%, and 24% reduction in Q1 of 2025 from <br>
                Canada, Mexico, and Germany respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the question is:<br>
                <strong>What impact has the second Trump Administration had on immigration to the U.S.?</strong>

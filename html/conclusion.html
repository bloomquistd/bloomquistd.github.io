        <p><strong>Fear, Policy, and Paperwork: A Summer of Immigration Uncertainty</strong></p>
        <p>
            Due to the lagging nature of the data, it's difficult to conclude if the Trump Administration's policies are<br>
            having an impact on the volume of USCIS forms received. The most recently reported data only encompasses<br>
            2 months of the administration.<br><br>
            However, the data indicates that the federal layoffs have exacerbated the situation. <br><br>

            In July, the Trump administration opened "Alligator Alcatraz" in Florida, and announced they would be making <br>
            changes to the H-1B program. Coupled with a summer filled with shocking videos of ICE deportation efforts, we will have to wait <br>
            and see if these policies will become a deterrent to those seeking their own American dream.

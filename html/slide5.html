      The increase reported for Q2 2025 encompasses January 1st, 2025 through March 31st, 2025. The American Immigration Council<br>
      reported the federal layoffs that have impacted immigration form processing. The Federal News Network reported in December <br>
      of 2024 that the agency was already about 2,0000 short of USCIS's authorized personnel total. The DOJ layoffs leaves the <br>
      remaining 700 or so immigration judges with average caseloads of about 5,600 cases each. The Trump administration has also<br>
      reduced the number of appellate immigration judges (who decide appeals of immigration judges) from 28 to 15.<sup><a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/federal-firings-immigration-processing-enforcement-expands/">[6]</a>
